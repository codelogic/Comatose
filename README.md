## Project Structure

* **html** - full html template and styling. Wordpress breaks everything up and it's hard to get a contigous look at the document structure. Plus, this might allow the theme to be ported to other platforms at some point.
* **theme** - wordpress development version of the theme. Not optimized for speed.
* **optimized** - release version of the theme. CSS in LESS files is compiled, javascript minified etc.

## Included Projects

This project includes several 3rd party libraries listed here:

* [Cufon](http://github.com/sorccu/cufon)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [less.js](https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js)
